## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS


### What I learned
Another fantastic challenge from codewell. The implementation of the design in code was quite straight forward, good practice for responsive layouts. I implemented my scss Media queries differently in this project to make them more maintainable:

```scss
    /**************************/
    /* BELOW 768px (Tablet) */
    /**************************/

    @include respond-to(sm){
        @include flex-center-column;
        flex-direction: column-reverse;
    }
```

I will be maintaining this approach for future projects.
